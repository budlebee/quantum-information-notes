# Discrete Variable quantum information

$$
\ket{\psi}=\alpha \ket{0}+\beta\ket{1}
qubit
$$





# Continuous Variable quantum information

qumode
$$
\ket{\psi}=\int dx\psi(x)\ket{x}
$$

variable x could be a position of particle or amplitude of electromagnetic field.

qumode also can be represented as discrete form 

$$
\ket{\psi} = \sum c_n\ket{n}
$$

In optics, $\ket{n}$ is a Fock state basis (photon number). 

qumode can be represented continuous variable $x$ or discrete variable $\ket{n}$. This approach is called as *"hybrid quantum computation"*.

physical quantity x and its conjugate (p) satisfy Heisenberg uncertainty principle. 

DV systems also have uncertainty. They have fluctuations in the observables.

# Optical classical computer

Optical classical computer requires nonlinear optical processes. nonlinear optical processes mean that physical events are different for each photon number state.

nonlinear optical process require high optical power or optical pulse. In medium, optical pulses have dispersion and it is problem. requirement of high nonlinear process and dispersion of fiber limit the speed of the optical classical computer. In addition, error corrections in optical classical computing is highly difficult.

CV optical quantum computers are possible to digitize the phase space that allows fault-tolerant quantum computation.
