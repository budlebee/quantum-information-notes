Some properties of density matrices $\rho$

1. $\rho$ = $\rho^\dagger$

2. $\rho$ is semi-definite : it's eigenvalues are non-negative.

3. $\rho$ is normalized : $Tr(\rho) = 1$

Some tricks:

1. For 4x4 density matrix $\rho$, $|\mathcal{R}(\rho_{14})|\le \sqrt{\rho_{11}\rho_{44}}$

why? by the definition, density matrix is classical sum of pure states

$$
\rho = \sum_{i}p_i|\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|
$$

let $|\psi_i\rangle=[a_i,b_i,c_i,d_i]^T$, then we can derive the inequality by hand-writting calculation.
