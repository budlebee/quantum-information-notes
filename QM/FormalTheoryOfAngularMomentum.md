Consider two angular momentum operators $J_1$ and $J_2$ in different subspace. Each operators satisfy angular momentum commutation relation:
$$
[J_i,J_j]=i\hbar \epsilon_{ijk}J_k
$$

But we have

$$
[J_{1k},J_{2l}]=0
$$

We define the total angular momentum by 

$$
J =J_1\otimes I + I \otimes J_2
$$

which is more commonly written as $ J=J_1 + J_2 $. Note that the total $J$ satisfies the angular momentum commutation relation.

Reducible: it can be decomposed into objects that transform differently under rotation.
